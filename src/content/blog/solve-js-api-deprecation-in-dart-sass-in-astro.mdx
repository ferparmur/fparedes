---

If you are building a website with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and SASS and you are getting this error when running builds or your dev environment:

`Deprecation [legacy-js-api]: The legacy JS API is deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 2.0.0.`

There's a very simple fix. The issue is caused by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which runs Astro builds under the hood trying to use the legacy API of the [sass npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass).
To fix it, you simply need to edit the Vite configuration. In Astro, you do that by using the [`vite` parameter](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#vite) in the `astro.config.mjs` file.
So you simply need to go to that file and add this option:

```typescript
// @ts-check
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";

// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
    // ... all your configuration
    vite: {
        css: {
            preprocessorOptions: {
                scss: {
                    api: "modern-compiler"
                }
            }
        }
    }
});
```

That will tell Vite to use the new compiler for Sass and stop using the deprecated one, which should remove the warning from your builds.
