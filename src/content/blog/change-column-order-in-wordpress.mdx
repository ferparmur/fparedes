Using the `manage_posts_columns` or `manage_$post_type_posts_columns` filter seems simple enough, right? But after
you do something like the suggested example from the [Codex](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/manage_posts_columns/),
you discover that it doesn't allow you to change the default column order in the WordPress editor screen.

```php
function add_sticky_column( array $columns ) : array {
    $columns['sticky'] = __('Sticky');
    return $columns;
}
add_filter( 'manage_posts_columns' , 'add_sticky_column' );
```

You’ll find out that adding it to the array this way leaves it in the last position.

## The Problem with Internet Answers
Many answers in StackOverflow and some tutorial sites suggest you to loop via `foreach()` through the `$columns` array.
But you probably think that something like that increases the complexity of your code without a good reason. And you
are right. So how to solve this in an elegant, efficient way?

## Splitting the Array: the Problem with the Intuitive Solution to Change the Order of Columns in WordPress
It’s actually very simple. You may think about using the `array_splice()` function to insert it at a specific index,
but this is not the best approach. For example, to insert the column at the index #3 in the array, you would do:

```php
function add_sticky_column( array $columns ) : array {
    $new_columns[ 'sticky' => __('Sticky') ];
    array_splice( $columns, 2, 0, $new_columns );
    return $columns;
}
add_filter( 'manage_posts_columns' , 'add_sticky_column' );
```

While this looks fine, the problem is that `array_splice()` resets the array keys from `$new_columns`. This is very
inconvenient since that very key is what generates the column id and class. More importantly, you need that key to
insert content in the column cells with `manage_posts_custom_column`.

## Splitting the Array the Right Way
In order to preserve it, there’s an easy solution: break the `$columns` array in two and insert the new one in
between taking advantage of [the union (+) operator](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.array.php):

```php
function add_sticky_column( array $columns ) : array {
    $new_columns[ 'sticky' => __('Sticky') ];
    $columns = array_slice( $columns, 0, 2, true )
        + $new_columns
        + array_slice( $columns, 2, 0, null, true);
    return $columns;
}
add_filter( 'manage_posts_columns' , 'add_sticky_column' );
```

## In conclusion:
- `array_slice()` allows you to break the original array in two at a specific point
- Thus, you can modify the order of your custom columns in the post editor.
- This way avoids increasing the complexity of your code with an unnecessary `foreach()` loop.
- It also preserves the array keys, while `array_splice()` doesn't, which is crucial to preserve the identity of the
column
- This way, you can easily change the order of your column in the WordPress editor.
